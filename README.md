# RevertFroggyNerf  

**RevertFroggyNerf** is a simple Quality of Life mod that allows configuring the limit of how many extra jumps you can get from the jump potion.  

 - Maximum jump cap is the vanilla value by default (3). You can configure it up to 99 with the singular configuration item that comes with this mod.  
	- You could also lower the maximum below 3 if that's more your style.  
 - NOTE: This mod is required by all clients as of version 1.0.2 (due to a recent game update)  
	- A client having this mod while the host does not should *not* allow the client to use the configured jump maximum.  
	- Similarly, if a client does not have this mod but the host does. Only the host will use the configured jump maximum.  
	- There is no configuration syncing going on, so please ensure all clients have the same value configured before reporting issues to me.
