# RevertFroggyNerf  

**RevertFroggyNerf** is a simple Quality of Life mod that reverts the jump potion nerf that limits how many extra jumps you can get.  

 - Maximum jump cap is raised from 1 to 3 by default. You can configure it up to 99 with the singular configuration item that comes with this mod.  
 - NOTE: This is a host-only mod and will not do anything if the host does not have it installed. (Clients do not need it)
